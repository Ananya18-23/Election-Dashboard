Election Analytics: 2019-2024 National & Bhopal Insights Dashboard

A dynamic visualization tracking Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) performance in the 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections, comparing national seat shares, vote volumes, and sweeps in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal region constituencies.

​
2. Short Description / Purpose

This dashboard analyzes BJP's electoral dominance, showcasing a drop from 303 seats in 2019 to 240 in 2024 nationally, alongside INC's rise from 52 to 99 seats, and total voter turnout increasing from 613 million to 645 million votes. Tailored for political analysts, party strategists, and voters in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, it highlights regional BJP sweeps to inform campaign planning and trend analysis.

4. Data Source
   
Election Commission of India (ECI) official results from results.eci.gov.in, summaries, and regional reports on 2019-2024 Lok Sabha polls. Structured data covers 543 national seats, ~645M votes in 2024, and 6 Madhya Pradesh constituencies (e.g., Bhopal, Vidisha) all won by BJP.

​
5. Features / Highlights
   
- Business Problem
  
Post-2024 elections, stakeholders need quick insights into BJP's national decline (303→240 seats) despite Madhya Pradesh clean sweeps, and vote share shifts amid rising turnout. Questions like "How did BJP retain Bhopal dominance?" or "What drove INC gains nationally?" remain hard without visuals.

- Goal of the Dashboard
  
Provide an interactive tool to compare 2019-2024 metrics, filter by party/constituency, and uncover trends like BJP's 37-38% vote share stability.
​
- Walkthrough of Key Visuals
 
Top KPIs (Left Panels): BJP seats 303 (2019) → 240 (2024); INC 52 → 99; pie charts for 613M (2019) vs 645M (2024) votes split by BJP/INC/others.
​
- Business Impact & Insights
 
Campaign Strategy: BJP can target national soft spots while leveraging MP strongholds like Bhopal (65%+ vote share).
Voter Analysis: Rising turnout signals engagement; INC gains suggest opposition momentum outside BJP bastions.
